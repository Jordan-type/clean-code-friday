# Node.js Clean Code Guide

This section focuses on writing clean, maintainable code using Node.js. Each project and tutorial in this folder demonstrates best practices in Node.js development, including:

- Using Express.js for building RESTful APIs
- Clean architecture and file structure
- Error handling and logging
- Asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await
- Writing modular code with CommonJS and ES6 modules

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate to the `nodejs/` folder. Each project has its own `README.md` file with setup instructions.

## Projects

- **REST API Example**: A simple CRUD API using Express.js
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Examples demonstrating async/await and Promises in Node.js

Feel free to explore and contribute to the Node.js section!
